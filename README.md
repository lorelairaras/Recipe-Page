# Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Challenge (Omelette)

This is my solution for the **Recipe Page** challenge from [Frontend Mentor]. It is the fourth challenge I’ve completed, and it focuses on building a responsive recipe layout using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 🥚 Project Overview

The project displays a simple and clean recipe page for a classic omelette. It includes the following sections:

- Recipe title and description
- Preparation time breakdown
- Ingredients list
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Nutritional information (per serving, no fillings)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout
- **Responsive Design** – works well on desktop and mobile
